I've created a fully functional PHP Todo App with the following features:
✨ Features:

➕ Add new tasks with a simple form
✅ Mark tasks as complete/incomplete by clicking checkboxes
🗑️ Delete individual tasks
📊 Statistics dashboard showing total, pending, and completed tasks
🧹 Clear all completed tasks at once
🕐 Timestamps for when each task was created
💾 Session-based storage (tasks persist during your browser session)

🎨 Design:

Modern gradient background
Smooth animations and hover effects
Responsive layout
Clean and intuitive interface

💡 How to use:

Save this code as todo.php
Place it in your web server directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP)
Access it through your browser (e.g., http://localhost/todo.php)
Start adding and managing your tasks!
